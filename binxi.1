.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBinxi\fR is a command line system information script built for for console 
and IRC. It is also used for forum technical support, as a debugging tool, 
to quickly ascertain user system configuration and hardware. inxi shows 
system hardware, CPU, drivers, Xorg, Desktop, Kernel, GCC version(s), Processes, 
RAM usage, and a wide variety of other useful information. 

\fBinxi\fR output varies between CLI and IRC, with some default filters and 
color options applied to IRC use. Script colors can be turned off if desired 
with \fB\-c 0\fR, or changed using the \fB\-c\fR color options listed in the 
OPTIONS section below.
.SH PRIVACY AND SECURITY
In order to maintain basic privacy and security, inxi filters out automatically 
on IRC things like your network card mac address, WAN and LAN IP, your \fB/home\fR 
username directory in partitions, and a few other things.

Because inxi is often used on forums for support, you can also trigger this 
filtering with the \fB\-z\fR option (\fB\-Fz\fR, for example). To override 
the IRC filter, you can use the \fB\-Z\fR option. This can be useful to debug 
network connection issues online in a private chat, for example.
.SH USING OPTIONS
Options can be combined if they do not conflict. Either group the letters 
together or separate them.

Letters with numbers can have no gap or a gap at your discretion unless using 
\fB \-t\fR.

For example: 
.B inxi 
\fB\-AG\fR or \fBinxi \-A \-G\fR or \fBinxi \-c10\fR

.SH STANDARD OPTIONS 
.TP
.B \-A  
Show Audio/sound card information.
.TP
.B \-b  
Shows basic output, short form (previously \fB\-d\fR). Same as: \fBinxi \-v 2\fR
.TP
.B \-B  
Shows Battery data, charge, condition, plus extra information (if battery present). 
Uses \fB/sys\fR or for BSDs, \fBdmidecode\fR. \fBdmidecode\fR does not have very 
much information, and none about current battery state/charge/voltage. Supports 
multiple batteries when using \fB/sys\fR data.

Note on the \fBcharge\fR item, the output shows the current charge, and the 
percent of the available capacity, which can be less than the original design 
capacity. In the following example, the actual current capacity of the battery 
is \fB22.2 Wh\fR, so the charge shows what percent of the current capacity 
is charged.

For example: \fB20.1 Wh 95.4%\fR

The \fBcondition\fR item shows the current available capacity / original design 
capacity, then the percentage of original capacity available in the battery. 
In the following example, the battery capacity is only 61% of it's original amount.

For example: \fB22.2/36.4 Wh 61%\fR
.TP
.B \-c 
\fR[\fB0\fR\-\fB32\fR] 
Available color schemes. Scheme number is required. 
  
Supported color schemes: \fB0\-42\fR
.TP	 
.B \-c 
\fR[\fB94\fR\-\fB99\fR]

Color selectors run a color selector option  prior to inxi starting which lets 
you set the config file value for the selection.

Color selectors for each type display (NOTE: irc and global only show safe color set):
.TP
.B \-c 94\fR
\- Console, out of X.
.TP
.B \-c 95\fR
\- Terminal, running in X \- like xTerm.
.TP
.B \-c 96\fR
\- Gui IRC, running in X \- like Xchat, Quassel, 
Konversation etc.
.TP
.B \-c 97\fR
\- Console IRC running in X \- like irssi in xTerm.
.TP
.B \-c 98\fR
\- Console IRC not in  X.
.TP
.B \-c 99\fR
\- Global \- Overrides/removes all settings.

Setting specific color type removes the global color selection.
.TP
.B \-C  
Show full CPU output, including per CPU clockspeed and CPU max speed (if available). 
If max speed data present, shows \fB(max)\fR in short output formats (\fB\inxi\fR, 
\fB\inxi \-b\fR) if CPU actual speed matches CPU max speed. If CPU max speed does 
not match CPU actual speed, shows both actual and max speed information. 
See \fB\-x\fR and \fB\-xx\fR for more options. 

CPU description includes technical CPU(s) description: \fB(\-MT\-MCP)\fR

* \fBMT\fR \- Multi/Hyper Threaded CPUs, more than 1 thread per core. (Previously \fBHT\fR)

* \fBMCP\fR \- Multi Core Processor (More than 1 core per CPU)

* \fBSMP\fR \- Symmetric Multi Processing (More than 1 physical CPUs)

* \fBUP\fR \- Uni (single core) Processor

.TP
.B \-d  
Shows optical drive data. Same as \fB\-Dd\fR. With \fB\-x\fR, adds features line to 
output. Also shows floppy disks if present. Note that there is no current way to get 
any information about the floppy device that I am aware of, so it will simply show the 
floppy id, without any extra data. \fB\-xx\fR adds a few more features.
.TP
.B \-D  
Show full hard Disk info, not only model, ie: \fB/dev/sda ST380817AS 80.0GB\fR. 
Shows disk space total + used percentage.  The disk used percentage includes space 
used by swap partition(s), since those are not usable for data storage. Note that 
with RAID disks, the percentage will be wrong since the total is computed from the 
disk sizes, but the used is computed from mounted partition used percentages. This 
small defect may get corrected in the future. Also, unmounted partitions are not
counted in disk use percentages since inxi has no access to that data.
.TP
.B \-f  
Show all cpu flags used, not just the short list. Not shown with \fB\-F\fR to avoid 
spamming. ARM cpus: show \fBfeatures\fR items.
.TP
.B \-F  
Show Full output for inxi. Includes all Upper Case line letters, plus \fB\-s\fR 
and \fB\-n\fR. Does not show extra verbose options like 
\fB\-d \-f \-l \-m \-o \-p \-r \-t \-u \-x\fR unless you use those arguments in 
the command, like: \fBinxi \-Frmxx\fR
.TP
.B \-G  
Show Graphic card information. Card(s), Display Server (vendor and version number), 
for example: 

\fBDisplay Server: Xorg 1.15.1 \fR

as well as screen resolution(s), OpenGL renderer, OpenGL core profile version/OpenGL 
version. 

If detected (currently only available if on a desktop: will attempt to show the 
server type, ie, x11, wayland, mir. When xorg is present, its version information 
will show after the server type in parentheses. Future versions will show compositor 
information as well.
.TP
.B \-h
The help menu. Features dynamic sizing to fit into terminal window. Set script 
global \fBCOLS_MAX_CONSOLE\fR if you want a different default value, or 
use \fB\-y <width>\fR to temporarily override the defaults or actual window width.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Same as \fB\-h\fR
.TP
.B \-H
The help menu, plus developer options. Do not use dev options in normal 
operation!
.TP
.B \-i  
Show Wan IP address, and shows local interfaces (requires \fBifconfig\fR or 
\fBip\fR network tool). Same as \-Nni. Not shown with \fB\-F\fR for user security 
reasons, you shouldn't paste your local/wan IP. Shows both IPv4 and IPv6 link IP 
address.

.TP
.B \-I  
Show Information: processes, uptime, memory, irc client (or shell type if run in 
shell, not irc), inxi version. See \fB\-x\fR and \fB\-xx\fR for extra information 
(init type/version, runlevel).
.TP
.B \-l  
Show partition labels. Default: short partition \fB\-P\fR. For full \fB\-p\fR output, 
use: \fB\-pl\fR (or \fB\-plu\fR).
.TP
.B \-m  
Memory (RAM) data. Does not show with  \fB\-b\fR or  \fB\-F\fR unless you use \fB\-m\fR 
explicitly. Ordered by system board physical system memory array(s) (\fBArray\-[number] 
capacity:\fR), and individual memory devices (\fBDevice\-[number]\fR). Physical memory 
array(s) data shows array capacity, and number of devices supported, and Error Correction 
information. Devices shows locator data (highly variable in syntax), size, speed,
type (eg: \fBtype: DDR3\fR). 

Note that \fB\-m\fR uses \fBdmidecode\fR, which must be run as root (or start 
\fBinxi\fR with \fBsudo\fR), unless you figure out how to set up sudo to permit 
dmidecode to read \fB/dev/mem\fR as user. Note that speed will not show if \fBNo Module 
Installed\fR is found in size. This will also turn off Bus Width data output if it is null. 

If memory information was found, and if the \fB\-I\fR line or the \fB\-tm\fR item have 
not been triggered, will also print the ram used/total.

Because dmidecode data is extremely unreliable, inxi will try to make best guesses. 
If you see \fB(check)\fR after capacity number, you should check it for sure with 
specifications. \fB(est)\fR is slightly more reliable, but you should still check 
the real specifications before buying ram. Unfortunately there is nothing \fBinxi\fR 
can do to get truly reliable data about the system ram, maybe one day the kernel devs 
will put this data into \fB/sys\fR, and make it real data, taken from the actual system, 
not dmi data. For most people, the data will be right, but a significant percentage of 
users will have either wrong max module size, if present, or max capacity.
.TP
.B \-M  
Show machine data. Device, Motherboard, Bios, and if present, System Builder (Like Lenovo).
Older systems/kernels without the required \fB/sys\fR data can use dmidecode instead, run 
as root. If using dmidecode, may also show bios revision as well as version. \fB\-! 33\fR 
can force use of \fBdmidecode\fR data instead of \fB/sys\fR. Will also attempt to show 
if the system was booted by BIOS, UEFI, or UEFI [Legacy]. The last one is legacy BIOS 
boot mode in a systemboard using UEFI but booted as BIOS/Legacy.

Device requires either /sys or dmidecode. Note that 'other\-vm?' is a type that means 
it's usually a vm, but inxi failed to detect which type, or to positively confirm which 
vm it is. Primary vm identification is via systemd\-detect\-virt but fallback tests that 
should support some BSDs as well are used. Less commonly used or harder to detect VMs 
may not be correctly detected, if you get a wrong output, post an issue and we'll get it 
fixed if possible.

Due to unreliable vendor data, device will show: desktop; laptop; notebook; server; 
blade plus some obscure stuff that inxi is unlikely to ever run on. 
.TP
.B \-n  
Show Advanced Network card information. Same as \fB\-Nn\fR. Shows interface, speed, 
mac id, state, etc.
.TP
.B \-N  
Show Network card information. With \fB\-x\fR, shows PCI BusID, Port number.
.TP
.B \-o  
Show unmounted partition information (includes UUID and LABEL if available).
Shows file system type if you have \fBfile\fR installed, if you are root OR if you have
added to \fB/etc/sudoers\fR (sudo v. 1.7 or newer): 

.B <username> ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/file (sample)

Does not show components (partitions that create the md raid array) of md\-raid arrays.
.TP
.B \-p  
Show full partition information (\fB\-P\fR plus all other detected partitions).
.TP
.B \-P  
Show Partition information (shows what \fB\-v 4\fR would show, but without extra data).
Shows, if detected: \fB/ /boot /home /opt /tmp /usr /var /var/tmp /var/log\fR. 
Use \fB\-p\fR to see all mounted partitions.
.TP
.B \-r  
Show distro repository data. Currently supported repo types:

\fBAPK\fR (Alpine Linux + derived versions)

\fBAPT\fR (Debian, Ubuntu + derived versions)

\fBPACMAN\fR (Arch Linux + derived versions)

\fBPISI\fR (Pardus + derived versions)

\fBPORTAGE\fR (Gentoo, Sabayon + derived versions)

\fBPORTS\fR (OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD + derived OS types)

\fBSLACKPKG\fR (Slackware + derived versions)

\fBURPMQ\fR (Mandriva, Mageia + derived versions)

\fBYUM/ZYPP\fR (Fedora, Redhat, Suse + derived versions)

(as distro data is collected more will be added. If your's is missing please 
show us how to get this information and we'll try to add it.)
.TP
.B \-R
Show RAID data. Shows RAID devices, states, levels, and components, and 
extra data with \fB\-x\fR / \fB\-xx\fR. 

md\-raid: If device is resyncing, shows resync progress line as well. 

Note: Only md\-raid and ZFS are supported. Other software raid types could 
be added, but only if users supply all data required, and if the software 
raid actually can be made to give the required output. 

Note: due to the complexity, only one raid type per system is supported. 
Md\-raid overrides ZFS if no ZFS was found.
.TP
.B \-\-recommends   
Checks inxi application dependencies + recommends, and directories, then shows
what package(s) you need to install to add support for that feature.
.TP
.B \-s
Show sensors output (if sensors installed/configured): mobo/cpu/gpu temp; 
detected fan speeds. Gpu temp only for Fglrx/Nvidia drivers. Nvidia shows 
screen number for > 1 screens.
.TP
.B \-S  
Show System information: host name, kernel, desktop environment (if in X), 
distro. With \fB\-xx\fR show dm \- or startx \- (only shows if present and 
running if out of X), and if in X, with \fB\-xxx\fR show more desktop info, 
like shell/panel etc.
.TP
.B \-t 
\fR[\fBc\fR or\fB m\fR or\fB cm\fR or\fB mc NUMBER\fR]\fR
Show processes. If followed by numbers \fB1\-20\fR, shows that number of 
processes for each type (default: \fB5\fR; if in irc, max: \fB5\fR)

Make sure to have no space between letters and numbers (\fB\-t cm10\fR 
\- right, \fB\-t cm 10\fR \- wrong).
.TP
.B \-t c\fR
\- cpu only. With \fB\-x\fR, shows also memory for that process on same line.
.TP
.B \-t m\fR
\- memory only. With \fB\-x\fR, shows also cpu for that process on same line. 
If the \-I line is not triggered, will also show the system used/total ram 
information in the first \fBMemory\fR line of output.
.TP
.B \-t cm\fR
\- cpu+memory. With \fB\-x\fR, shows also cpu or memory for that process on 
same line.
.TP
.B \-u  
Show partition UUIDs. Default: short partition \fB\-P\fR. For full \fB\-p\fR 
output, use: \fB\-pu\fR (or \fB\-plu\fR).
.TP
.B \-U
Note \- Maintainer may have disabled this function. 

If inxi \fB\-h\fR has no listing for \fB\-U\fR then it's disabled.

Auto\-update script. Note: if you installed as root, you must be root to 
update, otherwise user is fine. Also installs / updates this Man Page to: 
\fB/usr/local/share/man/man1\fR (if \fB/usr/local/share/man/\fR exists 
AND there is no inxi man page in \fB/usr/share/man/man1\fR, otherwise it 
goes to \fB/usr/share/man/man1\fR). This requires that you be root to write 
to that directory. 

Previous versions of inxi manually installed man page were installed to 
\fB/usr/share/man/man1\fR. If you want the man page to go into 
\fB/usr/local/share/man/man1\fR move it there and inxi will update to 
that path from then on.
.TP
.B \-V 
inxi version information. Prints information then exits.
.TP
.B \-\-version
same as \fB\-V\fR
.TP
.B \-v

speed, if available) + \fB\-G\fR + basic Disk + \fB\-I\fR.
.TP
.B \-v 2 
\- Adds networking card (\fB\-N\fR), Machine (\fB\-M\fR) data, Battery (\fB\-B\fR)
(if available), and shows basic hard disk data (names only). Same as: \fBinxi \-b\fR
.TP
.B \-v 3 
\- Adds advanced CPU (\fB\-C\fR); network (\fB\-n\fR) data; triggers \fB\-x\fR 
advanced data option.
.TP
.B \-v 4 
\- Adds partition size/filled data (\fB\-P\fR) for (if present):
\fB/ /home /var/ /boot\fR Shows full disk data (\fB\-D\fR)
.TP
.B \-v 5 
\- Adds audio card (\fB\-A\fR); memory/ram (\fB\-m\fR);sensors (\fB\-s\fR), 
partition label (\fB\-l\fR) and UUID (\fB\-u\fR), short form of 
optical drives.
.TP
.B \-v 6 
\- Adds full partition data (\fB\-p\fR), unmounted partition data (\fB\-o\fR), 
optical drive data (\fB\-d\fR); triggers \fB\-xx\fR extra data option.
.TP
.B \-v 7 
\- Adds network IP data (\fB\-i\fR); triggers \fB\-xxx\fR
.TP
.B \-w  
Adds weather line. Note, this depends on an unreliable api so it may not always 
be working in the future. To get weather for an alternate location, use 
\fB\-W <location_string>\fR. See also \fB\-x\fR, \fB\-xx\fR, \fB\-xxx\fR option.
Please note, your distribution's maintainer may chose to disable this feature, 
so if \fB\-w\fR or \fB\-W\fR don't work, that's why.
.TP
.B \-W <location_string>
Get weather/time for an alternate location. Accepts postal/zip code, 
city,state pair, or latitude,longitude. Note: city/country/state names must not 
contain spaces. Replace spaces with '\fB+\fR' sign. No spaces around \fB,\fR (comma). 
Use only ascii letters in city/state/country names, sorry. 

Examples: \fB\-W 95623\fR OR \fB\-W Boston,MA\fR OR \fB\-W45.5234,\-122.6762\fR 
OR \fB\-W new+york,ny\fR OR \fB\-W bodo,norway\fR.
.TP
.B \-y <integer >= 80>
This is an absolute width override which sets the output line width max. 
Overrides \fBCOLS_MAX_IRC\fR / \fBCOLS_MAX_CONSOLE\fR globals, or the 
actual widths of the terminal. If used with \fB\-h\fR or \fB\-c 94\-99\fR, 
put \fB\-y\fR option first or the override will be ignored. Cannot be 
used with \fB\-\-help\fR/\fB\-\-version\fR/\fB\-\-recommends\fR type 
long options. Example: \fBinxi \-y 130 \-Fxx\fR
.TP
.B \-z  
Adds security filters for IP addresses, Mac, location (\fB\-w\fR), and user 
home directory name. Default on for irc clients.
.TP
.B \-Z  
Absolute override for output filters. Useful for debugging networking 
issues in irc for example.
.SH EXTRA DATA OPTIONS
These options are for long form only, and can be triggered by one or 
more \fB\-x\fR, like \fB\-xx\fR. Alternately, the \fB\-v\fR options 
trigger them in the following way: \fB\-v 3\fR adds \fB\-x\fR; 
\fB\-v 6\fR adds \fB\-xx\fR; \fB\-v 7\fR adds \fB\-xxx\fR

These extra data triggers can be useful for getting more in\-depth 
data on various options. Can be added to any long form option list, 
like: \fB\-bxx\fR or \fB\-Sxxx\fR

There are 3 extra data levels: \fB\-x\fR; \fB\-xx\fR; and \fB\-xxx\fR

The following shows which lines / items get extra information with each 
extra data level.
.TP
.B \-x \-A

.TP
.B \-x \-i 
\- Show IP v6 additional scope data, like Global, Site, Temporary for 
each interface.

Note that there is no way I am aware of to filter out the deprecated 
IP v6 scope site/global temporary addresses from the output of 
\fBifconfig\fR. \fBip\fR tool shows that clearly.

\fBip\-v6\-temporary\fR \- (\fBip\fR tool only), scope global temporary. 
Scope global temporary deprecated is not shown

\fBip\-v6\-global\fR \- scope global (\fBifconfig\fR will show this for 
all types, global, global temporary, and global temporary deprecated, 
\fBip\fR shows it only for global)

for \fB\-i\fR. 

\fBip\-v6\-site\fR \- scope site (\fBip\fR/\fBifconfig\fR). This has been 
deprecated in IPv6, but still exists. \fBifconfig\fR may show multiple site 
values, as with global temporary, and global temporary deprecated.

\fBip\-v6\-unknown\fR \- unknown scope

.TP

\- Shows memory device Part Number (\fBpart:\fR). Useful to order new or 
replacement memory sticks etc. Usually part numbers are unique, particularly 
if you use the word \fBmemory\fR in the search as well. With \fB\-xx\fR, 
shows Serial Number and Manufactorer as well.
.TP
.B \-x \-m
\- If present, shows maximum memory module/device size in the Array line. 
Only some systems will have this data available.
.TP
.B \-x \-N
\- Adds version/port(s)/driver version (if available) for each Network card;
.TP
.B \-x \-N
\- Shows PCI Bus ID/Usb ID number of each Network card.

\- Adds wind speed and time zone (\fB\-w\fR only), and makes output go to 
two lines.
.TP
.B \-xx \-A 
\- Adds vendor:product ID of each Audio device.
.TP
.B \-xx \-B

Note that \fBvolts\fR shows the data (if available) as: Voltage Now / Minimum 
Design Voltage
.TP
.B \-xx \-C 
\- Shows Minimum CPU speed (if available).
.TP
.B \-xx \-D

type defaults. Note that not all systemd systems have the default value set, in 
that case, if present, it will use the data from \fB/etc/inittab\fR.
.TP
.B \-xx \-I 
\- Adds parent program (or tty) that started shell, if not IRC client, to shell 
information.
.TP
.B \-xx \-m
\- Shows memory device Manufacturer and Serial Number.
.TP
.B \-xx \-m
\- Single/double bank memory, if data is found. Note, this may not be 100% right 
all of the time since it depends on the order that data is found in \fBdmidecode\fR 
output for \fBtype 6\fR and \fBtype 17\fR.
.TP
.B \-xx \-M 
\- Adds chassis information, if any data for that is available. Also shows BIOS 
rom size if using dmidecode.
.TP
.B \-xx \-N 
\- Adds vendor:product ID of each Network card.
.TP
.B \-xx \-R
\- md\-raid: Adds superblock (if present); algorythm, U data. Adds system info 
sline (kernel support, read ahead, raid events). Adds if present, unused device 
line.  If device is resyncing, shows resync progress line as well.
.TP
.B \-xx \-S 
\- Adds, if run in X, display manager type to Desktop information, if present. 
If none, shows N/A. Supports most known display managers, like xdm, gdm, kdm, 
slim, lightdm, or mdm.
.TP
.B \-xx \-w / \-W
\- Adds humidity and barometric pressure.
.TP
.B \-xx \-@ <11\-14>
\- Automatically uploads debugger data tar.gz file to \fIftp.techpatterns.com\fR.
.TP
.B \-xxx \-B
\- Adds battery chemistry (like: \fBLi\-ion\fR), cycles (NOTE: there appears to 
be a problem with the Linux kernel obtaining the cycle count, so this almost 
always shows \fB0\fR. There's nothing that can be done about this glitch, the 
data is simply not available as of 2016\-04\-18), location (only available from 
dmidecode derived output).
.TP
.B \-xxx \-m
\- Memory bus width: primary bus width, and if present, total width. eg: 
bus width: 64 bit (total: 72 bits). Note that total / data widths are mixed up 
sometimes in dmidecode output, so inxi will take the larger value as total if 
present. If no total width data is found, then inxi will not show that item.
.TP
.B \-xxx \-m
\- Adds device Type Detail, eg: DDR3 (Synchronous).
.TP
.B \-xxx \-m
\- If present, will add memory module voltage. Only some systems will have this 
data available.
.TP
.B \-xxx \-S 
\- Adds, if run in X, shell/panel type info to Desktop information, if present. 
If none, shows nothing. Supports some current desktop extras like gnome\-panel, 
lxde\-panel, and others. Added mainly for Mint support.
.TP
.B \-xxx \-w / \-W
\- Adds location (city state country), weather observation time, altitude of system.
If wind chill, heat index, or dew point are available, shows that data as well.
.SH ADVANCED OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-! 31
Turns off hostname in System line. Useful, with \fB\-z\fR, for anonymizing your 
inxi output for posting on forums or IRC.
.TP
.B \-! 32
Turns on hostname in System line. Overrides inxi config file value (if set): 
B_SHOW_HOST='false'.
.TP
.B \-! 33
Force use of \fBdmidecode\fR. This will override \fB/sys\fR data in some lines, 
like \fB\-M\fR.
.TP
.B \-! 34
Skip SSL certificate checks for all downloader actions (\fB\-U\fR, \fB\-w\fR, 
\fB\-W\fR, \fB\-i\fR). Use if your system does not have current SSL certificate 
lists, or if you have problems making a connection for any reason. Only works 
with \fBwget\fR, \fBcurl\fR, and \fBfetch\fR. This must go before the other 
options you use.

.TP
.B \-! 40
Will try to get display data out of X (does not usually work as root user). 
Default gets display info from display \fB:0\fR. If you use this format: 
\fB\-! 40:1\fR it would get it from display \fB1\fR instead, or any display 
you specify as long as there is no space between \fB\-! 40\fR and the 
\fB:[display id]\fR. 

Note that in some cases, \fB\-! 40\fR will cause inxi to hang endlessly when 
running the option in console with Intel graphics (confirmed). Other free 
drivers like nouveau/ati unknown yet. It may be that this is a bug with the 
intel graphics driver, more information required.

You can test this easily by running this command out of X/display server: 
\fBglxinfo -display :0\fR

If it hangs, \fB\-! 40\fR will not work.

.TP
.B \-! 41
Bypass \fBCurl\fR as a downloader option. Priority is: Curl, Wget, Fetch,
HTTP::Tiny, OpenBSD only: ftp

.TP
.B \-! 42
Bypass \fBFetch\fR as a downloader option.Priority is: Curl, Wget, Fetch,
HTTP::Tiny, OpenBSD only: ftp

.TP
.B \-! 43
Bypass \fBWget\fR as a downloader option. Priority is: Curl, Wget, Fetch,
HTTP::Tiny, OpenBSD only: ftp

.TP
.B \-! 44
Bypass \fBCurl\fR, \fBFetch\fR, and \fBWget\fR as downloader options. This 
basically forces the downloader selection to use \fBPerl 5.x\fR \fBHTTP::Tiny\fR, 
which is in general slower than \fBCurl\fR or \fBWget\fR but it may help bypass 
issues with downloading.

.SH DEBUGGING OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-%
Overrides defective or corrupted data.
.TP
.B \-@  
Triggers debugger output. Requires debugging level \fB1\-14\fR 
(\fB8\-10\fR \- logging of data). Less than 8 just triggers inxi 
debugger output on screen.
.TP
.B \-@  
\fR[\fB1\fR\-\fB7\fR] \- On screen debugger output.
.TP
.B \-@ 8
\- Basic logging. Check \fB/home/yourname/.inxi/inxi*.log 
.TP
.B \-@ 9
\- Full file/sys info logging.
.TP
.B \-@ 10
\- Color logging.
.TP
.B \-@ <11\-14>
The following create a tar.gz file of system data, plus collecting 
the inxi output to file: To automatically upload debugger data 
tar.gz file to \fIftp.techpatterns.com\fR: 

\fBinxi \-xx@ <11\-14>\fR

For alternate ftp upload locations: Example: 

.B inxi \-! 
\fIftp.yourserver.com/incoming\fB \-xx@ 14\fR
.TP
.B \-@ 11 
\- With tree traversal data file read of \fB/sys\fR, and other system
data.
.TP
.B \-@ 12 
\- With xorg conf and log data, xrandr, xprop, xdpyinfo, glxinfo etc.
.TP
.B \-@ 13 
\- With data from dev, disks, partitions, etc.
.TP
.B \-@ 14 
\- Everything, full data collection.
.SH SUPPORTED IRC CLIENTS  
BitchX, Gaim/Pidgin, ircII, Irssi, Konversation, Kopete, KSirc, KVIrc, Weechat, 
and Xchat. Plus any others that are capable of displaying either built in or external 
script output.
.SH RUNNING IN IRC CLIENT
To trigger inxi output in your IRC client, pick the appropriate method from the 
list below:
.TP
.B Xchat, irssi 
\fR(and many other IRC clients)
.B /exec \-o inxi 
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]
If you leave off the \fB\-o\fR, only you will see the output on your local 
IRC client.
.TP
.B Konversation
.B /cmd inxi 
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]

To run inxi in konversation as a native script if your distribution or inxi package 
did not do this for you, create this symbolic link [the first works for KDE 4, 
the second for KDE 5]: 

.B ln \-s /usr/local/bin/inxi /usr/share/kde4/apps/konversation/scripts/inxi

.B ln \-s /usr/local/bin/inxi /usr/share/konversation/scripts/inxi

If inxi is somewhere else, change the path \fB/usr/local/bin\fR to wherever it 
is located.

If you are using KDE/QT 5, then you may also need to add the following to get 
the konversation \fR/inxi\fR command to work:

.B ln \-s /usr/share/konversation /usr/share/apps/

Then you can start inxi directly, like this:

.B /inxi 
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]
.TP
.B WeeChat
.B NEW: /exec \-o inxi 
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]

.B OLD: /shell \-o inxi 
\fR[\fBoptions\fR]

Newer (2014 and later) WeeChats work pretty much the same now as other console 
IRC clients, with \fB/exec \-o inxi \fR[\fBoptions\fR]. Also, newer WeeChats 
have dropped the \fB\-curses\fR part of their program name, ie: 
\fBweechat\fR instead of \fBweechat\-curses\fR.

Deprecated: 

Before WeeChat can run external scripts like inxi, you need to install the 
weechat\-plugins package. This is automatically installed for Debian users. 
Next, if you don't already have it, you need to install shell.py,
which is a python script. 

In a web browser, Click on the download button at:
.I https://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/stable/shell.py.html/

Make the script executable by

.B chmod +x shell.py

Move it to your home folder: \fB/.weechat/python/autoload/\fR then logout, 
and start WeeChat with

.B weechat\-curses

Top of screen should say what pythons scripts have loaded, and should include 
shell. Then to run inxi, you would enter a command like this: 

.B /shell \-o inxi \-bx

If you leave off the \fB\-o\fR, only you will see the output on your local 
weechat. WeeChat users may also like to check out the weeget.py
.SH INITIALIZATION FILE
inxi will read the following configuration/initialization files in the 
following order: 

\fB/etc/inxi.conf\fR is the default configurations. These can be overridden 
by user configurations found in one of the following locations (inxi will 
place its config file using the following precedence as well, that is, 
if \fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME\fR is not empty, it will go there, else if 
\fB$HOME/.conf/inxi.conf\fR exists, it will go there, and as a last default, 
the legacy location is used:

\fB$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/inxi.conf\fR or \fB$HOME/.conf/inxi.conf\fR or 
\fB$HOME/.inxi/inxi.conf\fR 

See wiki pages for more information on how to set these up:

.SH BUGS 
Please report bugs using the following resources. 

You may be asked to run the inxi debugger tool which will upload a data dump of all 
system files for use in debugging inxi. These data dumps are very important since 
they provide us with all the real system data inxi uses to parse out its report.

.SH  AUTHOR AND CONTRIBUTORS TO CODE
.B inxi
is is a fork of locsmif's largely unmaintained yet very clever, infobash script. 

Original infobash author and copyright holder:
Copyright (C) 2005\-2007  Michiel de Boer a.k.a. locsmif

inxi version: Copyright (C) 2008\-17 Harald Hope

Initial CPU logic, konversation version logic, occasional maintenance fixes, 
and the initial xiin.py tool for /sys parsing (deprecated but still very much 
appreciated for all the valuable debugger data it helped generate): Scott Rogers

Further fixes (listed as known): 

Horst Tritremmel <hjt at sidux.com>

Steven Barrett (aka: damentz) \- usb audio patch; swap percent used patch.

Jarett.Stevens \- dmidecode \-M patch for older systems with no /sys 

And a special thanks to the nice people at irc.oftc.net channels 
#linux\-smokers\-club and #smxi, who  all really have to be considered to 
be co\-developers because of their non\-stop enthusiasm and willingness to 
provide real time testing and debugging of inxi development. 

A further thanks to the Siduction forum members, who have helped get some 
features working by providing a lot of datasets that revealed possible variations, 
particularly for the ram  \fB\-m\fR option.

Further thanks to the various inxi package maintainers, distro support people, 
forum moderators, and in particular, sys admins with their particular issues, 
which almost always help make inxi better, and any others who contribute ideas, 
suggestions, and patches.

Without a wide range of diverse Linux kernel based Free Desktop systems to test 
on, we could never have gotten inxi to be as reliable and solid as it's turning 
out to be.

And of course, big thanks locsmif, who figured out a lot of the core methods, 
logic, and tricks used in inxi.
