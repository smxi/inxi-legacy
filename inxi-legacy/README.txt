README for inxi - a command line system information tool

NOTE: This is the LEGACY branch of inxi. So that you can run it
together with inxi, this version has been renamed to binxi (Bash
inxi) If you want the current Perl version, which is the only 
version which is maintained, go to the master branch.

This branch is here only for legacy historical purposes, or in case 
someone wants to work with the legacy inxi Gawk/Bash code themselves.

=====================================================================
If you want to run binxi, or clone this branch:

To run binxi:

MAIN BRANCH: master
DEVELOPMENT BRANCHES: inxi-perl, one, two, three.
ALTERNATE BRANCHES: inxi-legacy (this one), master-plain (without gz files)

PULL REQUESTS: None for this branch unless you did a really good job and 
it won't cost me time to integrate and test it.

inxi has one and only one release, and that is the current one (plus dev releases,
of course, but those should never be packaged). All previous releases are 
immediately obsolete on the commit of every new release. There is no exception to 
this, and never will be.

=====================================================================
ABOUT INXI - CORE COMMITMENT TO LONG TERM STABILITY

inxi is a command line system information tool. It was forked from the ancient
and mindbendingly perverse yet ingenius infobash, by locsmif. 

That was a buggy, impossible to update or maintain piece of software, so the
fork fixed those core issues, and made it flexible enough to expand the 
utility of the original ideas. Locmsif has given his thumbs up to inxi, so 
don't be fooled by legacy infobash stuff you may see out there.

=====================================================================
INXI FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY

Because trying to develop in Gawk -> Bash mix is almost impossible,
all future development is on the current Perl based development branch.

If you have issues or want new features, that's the branch to look at.

This branch is only for those wishing to suffer a bit, or who have
fond memories of the old version, and want to check it out.

=====================================================================
INXI RELEASE/SUPPORT/ISSUES/BUGS INFORMATION:

No bugs or issues will be accepted for the inxi-legacy branch, unless 
you submit a valid working tested patch that makes sense, and can be
dropped in, and won't break the code or feature set.
